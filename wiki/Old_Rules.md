# Old Rules
**These rules are from before 11/11/19, and are only here for archiving
purposes and referencing.**

## General Rules

### OOC Rules

These rules apply to OOC chat and meta stuff, and are to be punished by
non-IC means.

1.  ) **NO GRIEFING.** Griefing/teamkilling will get you banned right
    away at first offense, with no appeal. Claiming not to know the
    rules is not a valid excuse.
2.  ) **NO ERP.** Erotic Roleplay will get you kicked and warned at the
    first offense, and banned at the second.
3.  ) *' NO METAGAMING.*' Using knowledge from a previous life or as a
    ghost etc. knowledge you shouldn't know in your current IC
    character. Such as dying and running back to where you died to loot
    your own corpse or kill whoever killed you. You'll get a warning the
    first time and the next time is a ban, duration is up to the banning
    admin.
4.  ) No IC in OOC / Spouting memes IC or spamming OOC \[Punishment =
    Mute from OOC via player panel\]
5.  ) No ahelping sentence fragments. Say everything you want to say in
    one sentence. Spamming ahelp wont get you what you want.
    \[Punishment = AHELP ban via player panel\]
6.  ) No Obscene nicknames. Examples include naming yourself nigger
    while playing a Carib. Reference names such as Jack Sparrow and
    Black Beard, as well as other historic names and references, are
    allowed as long as your not overly obnoxious with it.
7.  ) Non player-targeted offenses and racism are allowed. Keep the chat
    clear from drama and do not troll or induce chaos. This will get you
    muted from OOC at best and banned at worst. Racism and offenses are
    allowed if they are purely used while IC and when Roleplaying, if
    applicable. (Example: Pirates being racist to Natives; Portuguese
    taunting the Spanish)
8.  ) Anything not listed in rules above is an IC problem and should not
    be ahelped. If you do ahelp them the admin has free choice whether
    or not its truly a valid complaint. If you feel an admin was wrong
    with their choice make a complaint on the discord and quote this
    section of the rules.
9.  ) Killing of SSD players will not be tolerated. You may loot them,
    but thats it. Under no circumstances are you to kill SSD players.
10. ) Being a toxic nuisance to staff and disrespecting staff multiple
    times even after being warned to stop can result in a ban.
11. ) You cannot kill yourself and respawn to get to whatever region you
    want to spawn at (Applies to some nomads maps). It's unfair to the
    rest. You get what you get and make the most of it.
12. ) Lying in Ahelps will get your ban increased or give you a ban. It
    causes confusion and generally makes yourself worse looking. Don't
    do it. Don't try to hide your own mishaps and turn it to your
    advantage. Misinformation isn't taken lightly.

### IC Rules

To be dealt with primarily by IC punishments. If those are unavailable,
or have no effect, OOC punishments will be applied.

1.  ) Play your role to the best of your abilities. Don't spawn as a
    Civilian/Support job and charge at the enemy. You have a job, do it
    (This does not include self defense. Someone comes at you with a
    sword, feel free to pick up that kitchen knife.). \[Punishment = Job
    ban / faction ban\]
2.  ) No team killing unless you are the captain and have a valid reason
    for execution. Examples include poisoning the stew, or blowing up
    groups of allies with canons or grenades on purpose. Individual
    fights are ok.

#### Faction Specific Rules

##### General

When playing as a faction on a map, keep in mind these facts:

1.  ) Each map has 2 rival factions, possibly a neutral faction, and
    possibly a friendly one (civilians) depending on the map.
2.  ) Neutral factions (Tribals,pirates possibly another faction
    depending on the map) can act aggressively towards any faction but
    if they do so it is expected that they get attacked by said faction
    (if they attack civilians they would be attacked by factions such as
    the Portuguese Spanish and British)
3.  ) It is against the rules to attack civilians unless the attacker is
    a pirate or a tribal. Exceptions can be found on Rule 1 of
    countries.
4.  ) the 2 rival factions (for example, in the naval battle map,
    Pirates vs Brits) are to always be aggressive towards each other.
5.  ) Attacking neutral factions that are passive is frowned upon unless
    if said faction is the pirates and the attacker is not the Tribals
    (this is to allow communication between the neutral faction and
    other factions to allow for alliances to be made.)

##### Countries

1.  ) Attacking Civilians is **NOT** allowed, except if said civilian
    is: 1) Carrying weapons when there are orders from high command for
    them to not do so; 2) Being aggressive towards the military forces;
    3) Entering off-limits areas (i.e. Ship's armory); 4) Voluntarily
    aiding or joining an enemy side.
2.  ) Disobeying officer orders will get you beaten. Respect the chain
    of command (though mutinies might be valid under some
    circumstances). Executions are possible but should be reserved for
    extreme cases (desertion, constant refusal to carry on orders even
    after being punished, being a traitor/aiding the enemy)
3.  ) Pirates are valid targets at all times, but restraint is
    encouraged unless they are overtly agressive.
4.  ) Natives should be avoided and treated with caution. We don't want
    to start a war with the tribes.
5.  ) Surrendering enemies should be taken prisoner if possible,
    especially if they are part of other countries - we are not savages.
6.  ) While alcohol rations are available, they are to be used with
    restraint. Being drunk in a combat situation will get you punished.
7.  ) The usage of enemy uniforms is dishonorable and should be punished
    and avoided. Soldiers on our side who use enemy uniforms are valid
    targets and risk getting mistaken for enemies.

## RP Gamemode Rules

### Civilizations/Nomads/Colony

Generally civilians whether it be Colony, civilizations, or 4 Colonies,
will be restricted to HRP. This means not running around spouting memes
and murdering people for the smallest things.

1.  ) No starting wars or conflicts with other civilizations, colonies,
    etc. Unless provoked with something really good. This means 2 guys
    fighting shouldn't start a war, thats a small conflict.
2.  ) You cannot begin wars or assaults through war until an
    announcement is made by an admin. If there are no admins on, then
    you cannot KOS the faction/tribe. You then have to show up and RP it
    confronting them. Such as "We're going to war with you, surrender
    and be assimilated or die."
3.  ) You cannot kill someone wordlessly. You must have escalating RP,
    good IC reason, and a confrontation. Such as someone stole your
    sweet roll. You ask them, "did you steal my sweet roll?", they reply
    "yes", to which you say "ok" and butcher them. Thats not allowed.
    Instead of "ok", say something that will warn them combat may ensue,
    such as "you have committed crimes against Dai Nam and her people,
    what say you in your defense?" and then they'll likely say "I'd
    sooner die!" and the fight begins or you/they make the first move.
    The only times escalation is void is in 1. An Admin announced war.
    or 2. When someone is told to stop, but runs away not allowing the
    escalation to take place, thus making it void.
4.  ) If you ahelp to have permission to assassinate someone (not
    escalating and killing them stealthily such as oil in their mug of
    wine) and they grant it then you may assassinate them thus not
    confronting them or escalating. But it needs good IC reason for it
    to be an assassination as well as be extremely stealthy. Not just
    pop out a closet and shank some king to death. (For admins they need
    approval from another admin whether it be through discord or in game
    chats).
5.  ) You cannot kill people that are "outlawed" without a word unless a
    public announcement was made and you actually heard or were informed
    of it. Not because your allies say they did something, you've no
    idea if that is true. A flyer can count as informing you. RP and
    Escalation (mainly a confrontation) is required once again after 5
    minutes when neither party has exchange blows. Meaning you can't be
    hit once and run off sniping them with a bow 20 minutes later.
6.  ) (In case of civilizations/nomads) You are not against the other
    tribes, you're all neutral. One of your main goals is to advance,
    not murder all the others. Create trade and diplomatic relations,
    not hostile guerrilla warfare battles.
7.  ) You cannot use a famous name that most are likely to know (eg.
    Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Ben Shapiro etc.)
8.  ) Act realistically to your wounds, meaning you can't lose an arm
    and say "Tis but a scratch!" and rambo whatever your against.
9.  ) Things that are realistically IC handled and easily handled,
    should be handled ICly. Such as a thief, a murderer with a good IC
    reason, or even corrupt government officials.
10. ) Revolutions shouldn't happen unless well organized, and have at
    least tried to gain more members. Otherwise its just one guy
    greifing the Town guards.
11. ) Speak at the current epoch/era. This means you don't say things
    like "bro" and "sis" at 313 B.C. It's too modern. No netspeak, type
    out the full words, and no internet memery.
12. ) FIRE is not a toy. You must have IC reason to burn a structure
    down (like a house), and it has to be controlled (meaning digging
    dirt around the "to be burnt" area). If you wish to create a fire
    that's uncontrolled say to destroy an enemy village in a war, AHELP
    IT. If theres no response, assume you can't and don't do it.
13. ) Do not take a side in a fight you stumble upon without knowing why
    it's happening. Ask first, then pick a side or stay out of it. Often
    it's either grief, failed escalation, or some corrupt guard tryna
    kill a civilian. Then you're taking the side of your fellow guard
    and helping them break a rule or break IC laws. Just try not to get
    involved in the first place.
14. ) If you don't know someone else's language and so you two try to
    communicate via paper, whispering, etc. or any other exploit making
    the language barrier void, depending on the method, admins can make
    you blind or deaf. You can use custom emote to try and signal/sign
    what you want to say without stating the actual message. Another
    method is describing a drawing, once again, without stating the
    actual message.
