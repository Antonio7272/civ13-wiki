# Civilization and Nomads

***"I'm cold and starving, [WHAT DO I
DO?](Civilizations#Starter_Guide "wikilink")"***

*- A confused player*

## What is Civilizations Mode?

Civilizations mode is a roleplay-focused mode in which players are
divided in up to 6 pre-determined factions, depending on the
player-count.

There is no predetermined goal.

What will each civilization desire? Military power? World domination?
Scholars with advanced technology? Mass resource output and production?
Commerce and trade? Raiding? It's up to you or your leaders to decide\!

## What is Nomads Mode?

Nomads mode is a subtype of the **Civilization 13** mode.

In Nomads Mode, everyone spawns without any pre-determined **factions**,
with only a knife and basic clothing.

You can stay factionless (a nomad), create your own or be invited to
one.

However, **research points** can only be collected if you have a
**faction**.

### Becoming Civilized

Perhaps you have noticed that your ability to craft things is a bit
limited in comparison to other people, and you would like to make more.
Perhaps you are finding surviving alone difficult. Perhaps you enjoy the
company and roleplay opportunity that comes with engaging with other
players. If those apply to you, then you should consider joining or
starting a faction.

The benefits of joining or assembling a faction...

  - You gain access to that factions research levels, which equates to
    [more things you can
    craft.](Civilizations_and_Nomads#The_Research_Milestones "wikilink")
  - More opportunity to roleplay in a manner you want to. From becoming
    a towns blacksmith, simple farmer, village idiot, to village
    chieftain, diplomat, emperor, or anything you want to try and make
    happen.
  - Depending on the faction, you might have access to shared resources
    and facilities.
  - Safety in numbers. Raiders will think twice before attacking a city,
    whereas a loner is an easy target for burglars, thieves, pillagers,
    and robbers.

## Factions

Factions are basically "teams". Everyone in the same faction shares the
same research points, and everyone in the faction contributes to
everyone else when they perform research.

But that also means that lazy people can take advantage of your
technology and resources and not contribute a thing...

A small tight-knit group of workers that contribute is often better off
than a large group of slackers that just consume.

Pick your members wisely\! Or cunningly use them to your advantage....

Work smart, not hard\!

### As a Leader

#### Creation

  - Open the **faction tab** and click **create a faction**.
  - Creating a faction makes you the default **leader**.

#### Management

  - You can invite people to your faction by getting close to them,
    **right-clicking** them, and selecting **recruit** from the menu.
  - You can leave a faction by clicking **abandon**
  - You **cannot** force someone to leave your faction; They have to
    select **abandon** themselves. How to get them to do that, is up to
    you...
  - You can make someone else the Leader by clicking **transfer
    leadership** while near your successor.

### As a Member

  - You cannot ask to join a faction, you can only be **recruited**.
  - Only the **leader** can recruit.
  - If the leader dies, anyone in the **faction** can **recruit**
  - Anyone in the **faction** can become a new **leader** if the current
    one is dead, by clicking **become leader**

## Surviving

### Nourishment

You will need to keep yourself in check, nourished and warm, to survive.
Also all hail potatos, you can make them into juice and make em into
fries.

Click your Thirst and Hunger icon on the right side (stomach icon) to
know how you're doing.

Nourishment affects:

  - Movement speed
  - Healing speed

#### Food

Thankfully, there are many ways to fill your stomach. Even an *unga
dunga* can do it\!

  - [Guide to Hunting](Guide_to_Hunting "wikilink")
  - [Guide to Ranching](Guide_to_Ranching "wikilink")
  - [Guide to Farming](Guide_to_Farming "wikilink")
  - [Guide to Cooking](Guide_to_Cooking "wikilink")

#### Drink

Feeling thirsty? Sip some water, milk, beer, tea, or anything liquid,
really.

Just remember that only water from **wells** are clean; All other water
needs to be boiled in **[copper or tin
pots](Guide_to_Mining "wikilink")**, or you risk getting [a nasty
surprise](Civilizations#Cholera "wikilink")

### Temperature

Winter seasons can bring an icy chill that can seriously hurt and slow
you down, or even kill you.

Keep an eye out on your temperature icon. If it's flashing blue with a
white snowflake, you're freezing up\!

  - Make yourself a [nice cozy fur coat](Guide_to_Crafting "wikilink")
    to stay warm.
  - Fur coats won't be enough to keep you warm in blizzards\! [Find
    caves](Guide_to_Mining "wikilink") or [build your own sheltered
    area](Guide_to_Carpentry "wikilink") to stay alive\!

### Environments and Maps

The environment lives and breathes, and will be the single biggest
factor that influences your life\!

Each map has different seasons, from the standard 4, to only 2, each
with their own peculiarities.

There is only one map for **Civilizations** mode. It will always be on
the **Temperate** map.

There are four different maps for the **Nomads** game mode, set in four
different biomes, detailed below.

#### Temperate

<img src="httpttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468979034571931650/524450345569484802/unknown.png" height=300>

This is the classic map, using the same map as the Civilizations map.

  - The map climate is temperate, with plenty of forests, rivers,
    overland mines, and farming space.
  - The northern part of the map contains most of the plains, while the
    southern part has most of the swamps and some beaches.
  - You may encounter mice, rabbits, bears, turkeys, cows, goats,
    snakes, deer, fish, frogs, leeches, horses, and alligators.
  - The round always starts in Spring.

It has four Seasons, and they will rotate every 30 minutes.

  - Spring: Amene temperatures, a little leftover snow from the winter.
    Sparse rains cause mud slowdowns. Snow starts melting.
  - Summer: Hot temperatures, no rain. Chance of heat-waves that
    evaporate all puddles. All snow melts. Wild animals respawn at a
    faster rate.
  - Fall: Cooler temperatures, sparse rain and occasional snowfall will
    slow you down.
  - Winter: Icy temperatures can kill you without a fur coat, some lakes
    and rivers freeze over, allowing you to walk on them. Constant
    snowfall slows you down, **crops will not grow and animals won't
    respawn**. Chance of blizzards that cause a whiteout, and can kill
    you even with fur coats. Have a shelter ready\!

#### Desert

<img src="httpttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468979034571931650/524449668181131284/unknown.png" height=300>

  - In this map, the whole area is a desert with some sparse water
    sources and farming plots.
  - Water management is important here, as is control of the rare
    farmable areas around rivers and swamps.
  - The round always starts in the Wet Season.

There are two seasons:

  - Dry Season: All the water sources dry up, has a chance of
    sandstorms, which impair vision, but cause no other ill-effects.
    Heat is intense and can harm you if you stay in the sun too long.
  - Wet Season: All water sources fill up, sandstorms die down. Wild
    animals respawn.
  - You may encounter mice, bears, goats, snakes, frogs, leeches,
    horses, camels, and alligators.

#### Ice Age

<img src="httpttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/468979034571931650/524444327166869504/unknown.png" height=300>

  - In this map, the whole area is covered in snow all year round.
    Resources (including wood, animals and minerals) are rare here, and
    snow can be used as a building material (as it wont melt during the
    Summer like in Temperate).
  - Permafrost prevents you from digging underground.
  - You may encounter wolves, deer, bears, penguins, goats, mammoths,
    and dogs.

There are two seasons:

  - Summer: Amene temperatures, some land melts, crops can grow. No
    chance of snowfall or blizzard. Wild animals respawn. Lasts a third
    of the time that Winter lasts.
  - Winter: Icy temperatures requiring coat, high chance of snowfall,
    chance of deadly blizzard. Crops stop growing, snow covers all land.
    Have a shelter ready or you probably won't survive until summer.

#### Jungle

<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/514547439215312916/534500616265924618/5nbewoIg42UAAAAASUVORK5CYII.png" height=300>

A dense tropical rainforest. It has two seasons, wet (where it rains all
the time and rivers flood) and dry (where fertile floodplains are
uncovered). You can only farm on the floodplains and during the dry
season. Wildlife is deadly here\! Stay away from panthers, mosquitoes
(as they carry malaria) and ants (will eat your food). Crossing rivers
without a bridge is considered unsafe - piranhas are abundant.

#### Divided

Jungle biome on West side, Desert biome on East side, separated by
mineable mountains and a small patch of clear land filled with
alligators.

#### Continental

Yet again, they done it, maybe because the god didn't get creative, or
something else, anyway there is ocean between, desert below, Ice Age
above, simple enough? Yet I understand why people thought the earth is
flat.

Tundra : Russian, Ukrainian.

` ^`

Temperate : German, Dutch.

` ^`

Desert : Arabian, Hebrew

` ^`

Jungle : Swahili, Zulu

#### Pangea

A combined map with no oceans dividing the biomes, excluding mountain
ranges.

Tundra: Russian.

`  ^`

Temperate: German.

`  ^`

Semi-Arid: Latin.

`  ^`

Desert: Arabian.

`  ^`

Savanah: Swahili.

`  ^`

Jungle: Japanese.

### Animals

The world is teeming with wildlife. Most of them are pretty tame and
easy prey, but steer clear of the big game unless you're a skilled
hunter, otherwise you'll become minced meat yourself\!

You want to avoid these, unless you're robust or need some pelts:

  - Bears (*can provide fur*)
  - Wolves (*can provide fur*)
  - Mammoths
  - Panthers & Jaguars
  - Snakes
  - Piranhas
  - Mosquitoes
  - Alligators

### Diseases

There are currently 5 diseases. Try not to catch them, they will make
your day a whole lot more miserable. Especially in early game, when
advanced medicine doesn't exist.

#### Plague

The rarest and the most lethal disease. If you have it, you will
probably die.

  - Caught from eating raw mice. Or standing too long near one.
  - Transmits from person to person.
  - It can be spotted by the lumps on your skin and vomiting blood.

#### Malaria

A deadly disease caused by parasites.

  - Transmitted by mosquitoes.
  - Does not transmit from person to person.
  - Will give you very high fevers with shivering and convulsions.
  - Untreated, it will give you brain damage from the fever, and
    possibly kill you.
  - Normally survivable without treatment, but won't give you immunity.
  - Damage can be greatly reduced by taking quinine (harvested from the
    Chinchona plant).

#### Cholera

A disease caused by water-borne bacteria.

  - Caught by drinking straight from puddles or water tiles without
    boiling it first.
  - Cannot be transmitted in any way.
  - Will cause you to convulse and vomit. This will dehydrate you fast\!
  - Vomiting will also cause you to lower the hunger level.
  - Dehydration will kill you without treatment.
  - Treatment is drinking plenty of water until the disease is gone. Any
    type of freshwater will do.
  - **TIP**: You can remove the risk of catching cholera by building a
    well on a puddle. Well water is pure.

#### Flu

Just a normal flu.

  - Caught randomly.
  - Easily transmitted from person to person. A single person can
    contaminate an entire village\!
  - Will very probably not kill you, but can be an annoyance, causing
    blurred vision, blackouts, and fever.
  - Untreated flu might give you brain damage from high fever.
  - Manageable by eating and drinking until full, and resting (buckling
    to a bed).
  - Brain damage can be prevented by drinking plenty of tea until the
    fever subsides.

#### Typhus

You've been covered with lice for days and now you feel sick.

  - throw up randomly
  - slightly transmittable fro person to person.
  - Untreated typhus will lead to your death
  - Treatment is through penicillin and tea.

## Research

  - [Guide To Research](Guide_To_Research "wikilink")

Research is one of the most important aspects of Civilization and
Nomads. It is with it that your faction can unlock new craftables and
better equipment\!

A small faction with advanced research and guns can usually topple the
big group of unga dunga cavemen armed with bows and arrows.

There are currently 4 modes of research.

Research mode is voted at the lobby, before the game begins.

Remember, **you need to create or join a faction to save research
points**\!

### Classic Research

The original research method\! And the most tedious...

Use a **Research Kit** on Scientific Literature, Scientific Rock Slate,
Scientific Books, or Bookcases.

You can make those with **wood** or **stone**.

The points you get depend on how advanced the person who wrote the
literature was, and what is the subject of their writing.

**TIP:** If you are struggling with your own research, progressing
slowly, it might be a good idea to see if any neighboring factions will
let you study their bookcases\! Buy, trade, and negotiate access to them
to boost your research. Or fight them, rob them... Get creative\!
(*within the rules*)

### Auto Research

As the name suggest, all factions in the world gain the same amount of
points in all areas at the same rate, without doing anything.

Sit back and relax. Or go plan a war against that one guy who looked at
you funny.

Just remember, if you can make guns, so can they...

### Resource-Based Research

In this mode, you create a **Research Bench** with **wood**, place any
items on it, and select a category to research.

This means that this mode rewards productivity and exploitation of
natural resources. No slacking off\!

Different items are worth different amounts.

Experiment\!

### No Research

In this mode, you're stuck in the epoch you started in, with all
technology of that epoch unlocked.

Research mechanics won't yield any improvements.

### Chad Mode

*It started as a joke, now it's too late to go back...*

Essentially it is No Research, but **without any IC rules whatsoever**.

Really. You can do anything you want, without any bwoinks. EXCEPT FOR
ERP.

## The Research Milestones

A list of the most important technology that you'll unlock, and at what
research level.
This is just a list of major milestones - For the full list of
craftables (over 700\!) with all the costs and necessary research
levels, check [Full Crafting List](Full_Crafting_List "wikilink").

# Starter Guide

### Spawning in

  - When you spawn, you will be told the languages you know. Your
    appearance and language will be determined by your spawn location.
  - Your **hunger** and **thirst** levels will both be at 50%.
  - You start out with nothing your first priority will be to gather a
    flint axe to make one grab intent a rock and click on it you should
    be able to gather some flint. Hit the flint on the rock until its
    sharp (via left clicking the rock you got it from with the flint).
    Now go to a tree and click it on harm intent. This will pull a
    branch from the tree and place it on the ground. Grab intent the
    branch to clear the leaves, then harm intent to pull out the twigs.
    Use the flint on the stick to sharpen it then again to craft
    yourself a trusty flint axe.
  - If it's **winter season** or **Ice Age** map, you also spawn with a
    **fur coat**. Losing this will mean cold and miserable **death** in
    the icy outdoors.

### Staying Alive

  - Hunger and thirst affect your **movement speed** and **healing
    rates**.
  - Being slow makes you easy prey for predators, criminals, and
    cannibals.
  - Being malnourished also makes it easier to catch **disease** and
    increase your **healing time**.
  - Letting either **hunger** or **thirst** reach 0% will cause your
    body to start shutting down, until your inevitable **death**.
  - **Cold can kill**. Being caught in a **blizzard** or **winter**
    without proper protection is a very easy way to **die**.

#### Crafting Basics

You'll need **wood** to make things to eat and drink.

  - Hit a tree with your flint hatchet and it will cut it down after a
    delay.
  - Get the wood and use it in the active hand to open a crafting menu.

The same mechanic for opening crafting menu applies to all materials.
Activate in hand to open the crafting menu.

#### Hunger

The easiest way to get food early on is by killing animals and eating
the meat after cooking it.

  - Find an animal and kill it with the knife, preferably one that
    doesn't have fangs, claws, tusks, or poison. **Stay away from bears,
    alligators, wolves, snakes, and mammoths.**
  - Use your knife on it with **harm intent** to butcher it.
  - **Raw meat** causes **food poisoning**. You'll want to **cook** it,
    **stew** it or **dry** it first, <sub>dew it</sub>, but if you're
    starving, food poisoning is the least of your worries.
  - To cook meat, place it on a **campfire**.
      - You can make one with **wood logs**.
          - You can also use an **oven**.
  - To **dry** meat, cut the raw steak into **raw cutlets**, then place
    them on a **dehydrator** and wait.
      - Dehydrators are made of **wood**, but you need some research
        levels.
  - To **stew** meat, place the raw steak into the **cooking pot** after
    filling it with **water**, and wait.
      - Cooking pots are made with **iron ingots**, but again, it
        requires research levels to make.

### Thirst

The easiest way to quench your thirst early on is by drinking water or
milk, though other liquids like **tea** can also be used.

##### Water

You can get water from **puddles**, any **water tiles**, or **wells**.

  - To drink, you need to make a **mug** from **wood** or **drinking
    glass** from **glass**.
  - **Wells** have disease-free freshwater. You can build them over a
    **puddle** by using with **stone**....**if** your faction has the
    research levels required....
  - "Raw" water needs to be **boiled** to be 100% safe. Otherwise, you
    have a **chance** of catching **cholera**. Though if you're dying,
    raw water will be a risk you'll have to take.
  - To boil water, make a pot from **tin** or **copper** ingots.
  - **Intermission: MINING BASICS** : You'll need **wood** and **bone**
    for this. Go gather them.
      - Make a **tool handle** from **wood**.
      - Hold it in the **off-hand**.
      - Activate some **bone** in your **active-hand**.
      - Make a **pickaxe**.
      - Find a **rock** and use the **pickaxe** on it. **WARNING: BUILD
        MINING SUPPORTS WITH WOOD EVERY 2 TILES OR YOU WILL HAVE A
        CAVE-IN**
      - Grab the **copper or tin ores** and **smelt them** into
        **ingots** in a **campfire**.
      - Use the **ingots** in-hand to craft a **pot**.
  - Fill the **pot** with **water**, place it on **campfire** or
    **oven**, turn it on, and wait for it to finish boiling.
  - Water is then safe to drink. Pour it in your **mug** or **glass**
    and drink.

##### Milk

  - Find a **cow**, **sheep ewe**, or **goat ewe**.
  - Make a **bucket** from **wood**.
  - Use the **bucket** on **help intent** on the animal of choice to
    gather milk.
  - Pour the milk into the **mug** or **glass** and drink.
  - You don't have to boil milk.

Milk is regenerated in the animals over time, so keep them alive, and
you'll never go thirsty.

### Surviving the Winter

Being caught in the winter without protection will kill you. And even
with a fur coat, a blizzard will make short work of you.

##### Fur Clothing

Fur clothing can keep you warm in the winter, but won't keep you from
dying you're caught in a blizzard.

You can make fur clothing by skinning large furry animals like **bears**
and **wolves**. <sub>Yes, you can finally skin furries with no
repercussions.</sub>

  - Kill a **bear** or **wolf**.
  - Skin the animal by using the **knife** on **grab intent**.
  - Collect the pelts and craft a **fur coat** (and **fur boots**, if
    you don't want to freeze your feet).

##### Shelter

Shelter can save you from even the toughest of conditions.

Any roofed area is considered a shelter.

  - **Caves**: There's a reason that stone-age men were called cavemen.
    Look for entrances in rocks. If it has a roof, it will be darker
    inside. That means it will keep snow, cold, and rain out. The
    easiest way of surviving inclement weather. <sub>Make sure that no
    bears live in the cave, though...</sub>
  - **Tunnels / "Mines"**: You can dig into the underground for
    shelter\! All you need is to use a **shovel** in your active hand.
    To craft one, you'll need to make a **tool handle** from **wood
    planks**, and have **bone** available. With the **tool handle** in
    the off-hand, activate **bone** in the active hand.
  - **Building a Roof**: Target your inner Bob the Builder and build
    your own roof. You'll need **wood planks**.
      - Build **walls** or **roof supports** to prop the ceiling up.
      - Build a **roof builder**, hold it, and activate it in hand while
        facing the tile above which you want to build.
      - You can also build walls with **dirt** or **snow** by using the
        **shovel** directly on the ground. Just use the **dirt** or
        **snow** piles in your **active hand**, then add additional
        material directly to the wall.

#### Night Time

You'll need a light source to see in the night and in dark indoor areas.

The basic source of light is the **torch**.

  - Gather some **wood**.
  - Craft a **torch** in the **Kitchen & Other** submenu
  - An alternative to the torch is a tiki torch it burns for longer and
    provides larger source of light

Torches will last for **5 minutes** and then burn out.

  - you can also make '''lanterns '''with iron in the tool category
    lanterns require fuel any form of liquid fuel will do.

For a more **permanent** light source, you can build **braziers** from
**stone**. You can fuel it with any organic matter like wood or
clothing, simply use items on the brazier on **help intent**.

  - In later epochs you will be able to craft lights from glass and
    power them up get glass and go the the electricity category face the
    direction you would like the light to face and build it to power
    lights click on the light frame with a cable coil and connect it to
    a power generator.
