# Guide to Farming
Being a grower of crops is an important role. You farm both food and
cash crops. Growing food is vital for a nation to increase in wealth and
power.

## Tools

To farm, you will require some basic tools.

You can also plough snowy dirt and flooded plains dirt (found along the jungle rivers). In case of snowy grass, you will have to shovel the snow first. Lastly, there are places where you cannot plough: infertile soil, permafrost etc. You can also make an iron plough out of iron ingots to plough land faster.</p></td>

## Farming

Just plough a plot of land, surround said plot of land with trenches
filled with fresh water or plough near a river, put some seeds in the
ground and watch them grow\! Well, it is a bit more nuanced.

### Watering

Plants need water, some more, others less. Weather conditions and
climate also affect the crops in this regard. Each crop has a maximum
water level when planted.

Normally, the water level decreases at the rate of 15 per minute, and
when it reaches zero, the plants wither away. However, in the hot
climates of the Desert and Semi-Arid biomes, water consumption is 25 per
minute. On top of that, in the event of a heatwave, plants will require
more water than usual - additional 10 per minute.

There are a few ways to provide the crops with water:

  - Plough land within two tiles of fresh water, which is any water,
    except for the saltwater. The plants will have all the water they
    need without any extra labor.
  - Dig a water channel from the nearest fresh water to irrigate remote
    fields. For this a trench shovel is required, which becomes
    available at the 14 industrial research mark. Dig the first trench
    on a lakeshore or on a riverbank, then the second trench next to the
    first one and so on. Farming fields should be within two tiles of
    the water channel as well.
  - Water the plants manually. Bring the fresh water in Buckets and
    Barrels and splash it on the ploughed field (not the plant).
  - Pray for the eternal rain. Rain will water the fields (at the rate
    of 15 per minute), but may create other inconveniences.

### Fertilizing

Many kinds of animals leave manure on the ground, which could be used to
fertilize a ploughed field. Fertilizing one tile will affect all
adjacent tiles or nine tiles in total. Plants that grow on the
fertilized soil produce twice as much harvest.

### Severe weather

Be aware that blizzards will freeze the plants and kill them. A
heatwave, as noted in the Watering section, will cause the crops to
consume more water than usual. Sandstorms will also destroy the plants.
You can try to cover them during the winter with tents, however, be sure
to remove them in spring or they won't keep growing\!

### Skill

Every time you make a ploughed field and plant seeds you gain more
insight into the business of agriculture. When your farming skill
reaches 1.6, examining a plant will, in general terms, tell you whether
it has enough water. At 2.2, you will be able to determine the exact
water level of a plant.

### Biomes and seasons

Different biomes have different plants that could be cultivated in them.
Take notice, that some plants grow only in certain seasons. Biome
restriction applies only to the largest maps: Continents, Pangea and New
World.

Wet (winter and spring) and dry (summer and fall) seasons apply to the
Desert, Savanna and Jungles biomes.
