# Governor

You're the Governor and respective leader of the Colony. The way you
lead depends on you. Usually you should try to be nice to the people and
gain their support, since it means they aren't going to want to murder
you. Try to keep a steady flow of goods coming and an out via yourself
or the merchants. It's best to write some laws so your guards know what
to enforce.

## Steps

These are some basic steps of what to do after you spawn in.

1.  Create a paper of laws and put it on the notice board.
2.  Announce said paper and inform people to read it, make sure copies
    were made since some unga is gonna take that paper and crumple it.
3.  Make sure all the guards are enforcing said laws.
4.  Start some building projects, specifically a store or medical
    clinic.

## Some laws you can make

1.  You must have a permit stamped and signed by the governor to own a
    firearm
2.  Theft is punishable by death
3.  Breaking and entering will be punished by death
4.  You must have a permit signed and stamped by either the governor or
    the head architect to build a structure.
5.  You cannot harm a native or foreigner without permission from the
    governor unless it is in self defense
6.  Disrespect to the guards or governor is punishable by death

These are just some laws you can enforce that should create a more
stable less chaotic colony.

## Exporting and Importing

### Importing

With silver/reales in your hand, you can click on the supply orders book
and put the money in. This will make it so you can click on it again
with an empty hand and it will open a list. This list contains crates
and supplies you can order. Click on the option you want and the
purchased item, crate, or mob should arrive soon by dock or shipping
area. After the option is selected it will subtract the cost directly
from the money you put in, if you haven't enough, it doesn't work.
Either way it will eject your money and you can retrieve the remaining
coins. Then just wait for it to arrive.

### Exporting

Exporting is different. You simply hold the item you want to export, and
click on the exporting table. Then click yes and it will sell this to
the world and be consumed. Money is ejected in return. This doesn't work
for all items.
