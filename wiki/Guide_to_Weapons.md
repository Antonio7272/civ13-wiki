## How to use artillery

This is the artillery menu. From the top to the bottom:

1.  The shell you have loaded
2.  How far you are aiming to hit
3.  The deviation to the right/left of the shell (from your character's point of view)

To have a higher chance of success at firing artillery shells on your
enemies' territory, it's best if you have a telescope in hand. Or even
better yet, a "spotter" to have their telescope always on the target,
telling you where to aim while you control the artillery.

  - Each tile further means you'll have to add the value of "1" to the
    distance. If you want to hit 45 tiles away, you must aim for "45"
    distance.*

  - The sway is the "deviation" or just sway, that the shell will be
    affected by. If you fire from coordinates that aren't exactly
    aligned with your enemy, you can use these to move your shell
    left-to-right instead of moving the artillery.

  - You will need to load a shell before firing, you can clearly see if
    there's one by checking the panel.

  - There are many kinds of shells, like chlorine shells, zyklon B
    shells, white phosphorus shells, makeshift nuclear shells and many
    more, but let's see these more simple examples.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Civ13/civ13-wiki/master/assets/images/okbGhZ8.png) This is a
<b>H</b>igh-<b>E</b>xplosive shell, it will create a big explosion where
it lands, spreading fire along. Great if your enemy has houses made out
of wood or if there's grass around.

This is an
<b>A</b>rmor-<b>P</b>iercing shell, it will pierce through the armour of
tanks.


**All the other shells are:**

| Chlorine          | Designed to cause overexposure to the chlorine element, it causes
respiratory system failure and severe nose and throat irritation                                                                   |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Mustard           | A man\-made agent which causes chemical burning of the skin, eyes, and
throat, very nasty stuff\.                                                                                                    |
| Phosgene          | A far more potent and well disguised cousin of chlorine gas, it has a
slightly delayed but otherwise identical effect\.                                                                              |
| White Phosphorus  | A type of pyrophoric incendiary munition, it ignites air creating a
large smoke cloud\. Temperatures high enough to cause fourth degree burns
to anyone unfortunate enough to be in direct contact\. |
| Xylyl Bromide     | Primarily used as a "tear gas" type agent\. Stereotypical respiratory
pain and eye, skin, and throat irritations\. Not heavily lethal, however\.                                                     |
| Zyklon B          | Cyanide\-based pesticide, it impedes upon cellular respiration\. In
simpler words it 'deactivates' the entire human body within minutes
post\-inhalation\.                                           |
| APCR              | A shell designed with a hard metal penetrating core, it has extreme
penetrative force made to wound tank crews and disable vehicle
components\.                                                      |
| AP                | A steel alloy shell designed to survive the shock of direct hits against metal armor and continue going\. Not exactly fancy but it works\.                                                           |
| HE                | A shell designed to inflict as much concussive explosive force as
possible, applications include destruction of fortifications or direct
anti\-personnel usages\.                                    |
| Makeshift Nuclear | A shell designed to irradiate a large area for long periods of time\.                                                                                                                                |
