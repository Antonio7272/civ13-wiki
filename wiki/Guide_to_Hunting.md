### WELCOME TO THE HUNTING GUIDE\! LET ME HELP YOU TO HUNT THINGS.

First off you may need a weapon, because you can encounter evil animals,
humans are not expection, You could make one out of wood, Let me state
the best weapons i would recomend you to hunt with.

  - WOOD SPEAR (Makes out of wood) Very
    powerful[바카라사이트](https://www.xn--o79ak1s1tdy0owni.kr/)
    if thrown into enemy. You can butcher things with it, but not the
    humans.
  - BOW (Makes out of wood) Requires arrows or poisoned arrows to fire,
    arrows are made out of wood, but to make poisoned arrows would be
    complicated, so the hint is, find poisonous frog, Bow is the most
    safest weapon to hunt with, because it would save you from hunting
    animals in melee witch can cease your death.
  - ANY SWORD (Makes out of materials, COPPER IRON And many more??) Can
    be pretty good to hunt with, but only available at some point in
    epoch.
  - GUN (Makes out of Iron) Guns are guns, perfect weapon to one shot
    prey with.
