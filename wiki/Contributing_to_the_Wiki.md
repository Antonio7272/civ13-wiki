# Contributing to the Wiki

Since this wiki is hosted on *github pages* using static Jekyll pages, it works slighly different from a regularly hosted wiki.

However, don't worry! It is simpler than it seems. You do **not** need to download the code (altough you can if you want to edit it locally). Follow the steps below:

1) If you do not have one yet, register for a **Github Account** [here](https://github.com/join).

2) Fork the wiki by going to the main project page [here](https://github.com/Civ13/civ13-wiki) and pressing the *Fork* button on the top right.

3) Go to your fork of the wiki, open settings, and scroll down to **GitHub Pages**. Make sure it looks similar to the screenshot below by activating Github Pages:

4) You can now open the wiki using the link shown there. It will look similar to https://**YOURUSERNAME**.github.io/civ13-wiki

5) You're all set! Just edit by either creating a new page, or selecting **edit** on the top right menu, like the image below:

6) When you feel that your changes are good enough, just open a pull request to the main repository (the one you forked), and if accepted, it will be displayed on the page!

7) Make sure you regularly update your repository to keep it up to date.
