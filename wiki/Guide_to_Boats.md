### When to make a boat

Its best to make a boat on maps like the new world or continents it
doesn't really make sense to make a boat on something like Pangea. Boats
can be built in 1013

### How to make a boat

First you need to lay down some boat frames made from wood but it cant
be bigger than 5x5. Then you can add walls by clicking on frames with
wood to customize and defend. You need a mast and a controller so get
those, wrench them down, then once you need a axis depending on your
boat size, place it on the top left of the boat. Then you should be able
to see a panel when you click on the controller. BUT you cant move with
it because you need a sail to attach to the mast. To get a sail grow 15
cotton then process that to make it.
