# Colony Medic
## Building A Medical Clinic

One of the first things you should do as a medic is try and get a
medical clinic built. Usually you should talk to the Governor or Head
Architect about its construction, but if there are none, try to
commission a carpenter. Your Medical Clinic should be equipped with
multiple beds to lay the waiting wounded, at least one operating room,
and a stockpile of trauma and burn kits. If you're forced to scavenge
try Healing Herbs instead of the Trauma Kits.

### Your Job

You must take care of the colonists and make sure they're in top health.
This includes the heavily wounded requiring surgery, to the guy who got
a slap on the face for hitting on a nun. Even treat people with the flu.
Your duties are not little and should not be taken lightly. If you wish
to charge a fee for your medical services or not, is up to you to
decide.
