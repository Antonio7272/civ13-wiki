Being a blacksmith is fairly easy. Get iron or steel, craft things, sell
those things. But theres more than just that\!

## Setting Up

A typical set up for a Blacksmith is first, a Smithy. Make a nice place
you can craft your things, it's usually good to have it combined with a
store behind locked doors. You'll need an anvil, and optionally you
could have a stone furnace for making steel etc. as well as an oven for
smelting iron. Optionally (and probably a good thing to do) is make the
smithing area itself from stone, not wood, since wood doesn't make much
sense around hot metal.

### The Job

The main thing you're gonna be doing is selling to the public, weapons.
If allowed. Otherwise sell to any available merchant so they can export
it. A good thing generally to make for them to sell is muskets and other
guns. Swords don't export for much and are still costly on iron. Guns
the merchant can give you a good slice of reales, though, you should
never take anything less thank 2x the iron amount it took to make. Such
as a musket, 30 iron, you shouldn't take less than 60 reales and thats
just breaking it even. Though the merchant is probably gonna be your
best friend in terms of business. The rest, is up to you to decide.
